# Images Directory

Place your images and videos in this directory. The template uses these images for:

1. **Your profile picture**: Add a professional photo named `YourPhoto.jpg` or update the reference in index.html
2. **Project images**: For each project section, add:
   - A static image (`project_name_before.jpg`) that appears by default
   - A second image or video (`project_name_after.jpg` or `.mp4`) that appears on hover

## Image Hover Effect

The template uses a hover effect where moving your mouse over an image reveals a second image or plays a video. Make sure to:

1. Use the same dimensions for paired images (160x160px works well)
2. Update the JavaScript function names in each project section to match your filenames
3. Keep video files reasonably small for faster loading

## Favicon

Place your site favicon in the `favicon` subdirectory. The default reference in index.html is:
```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
```

## Example Placeholder Images

This repository includes some example placeholder images that you should replace with your own content:
- `project1_before.jpg` - Default static image
- `project1_after.jpg` - Image shown on hover
- `YourPhoto.jpg` - Placeholder for your profile picture

Replace these placeholder files with your own images keeping the same filenames, or update the references in the HTML.
