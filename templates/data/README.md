# Data Directory

This directory should contain your personal documents and data files referenced on your website, such as:

1. **CV/Resume**: `YourName-CV.pdf`
2. **Bio**: `YourName-bio.txt` (a short biography text file)
3. **Publications**: BibTeX files or other publication references
4. **Other Documents**: Any other documents you want to link from your website

## Example Data Organization

```
data/
├── YourName-CV.pdf        # Your CV/resume
├── YourName-bio.txt       # Short biography
├── publications.bib       # BibTeX file with your publications
└── other-documents/       # Optional subdirectory for other files
    └── presentation.pdf
```

## Important Notes

1. Make sure to update the links in `index.html` to point to your actual files
2. Keep filenames consistent with references in your HTML
3. Consider file sizes - large PDFs may slow down your website

Replace the placeholder files with your own documents.
