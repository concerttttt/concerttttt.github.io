# Academic Personal Website Template

This is a clean template based on Jon Barron's academic website (https://jonbarron.info/). This template has had all personal information removed for easier adaptation to your own personal website.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this repository or create a new one**
   - If you're creating a new repository, name it `yourusername.github.io` for GitHub Pages

2. **Replace the placeholder content**
   - Modify the `index.html` file with your own information:
     - Change "Your Name" to your actual name
     - Replace the placeholder text in the bio section
     - Update the links (email, CV, etc.)
     - Replace the profile picture (in the images folder)
   - Add your own projects/publications using the provided templates
   - Update or remove sections as needed

3. **Image and file organization**
   - Place your profile photo in the images folder
   - For each project, create before/after images or videos as needed
   - Place your CV, bio, and other documents in the data folder

4. **Customization**
   - The main styling is in `stylesheet.css` which you can modify as needed
   - The highlight color for links is defined in the CSS (#f09228)
   - The background color for highlighted projects is #ffffd0
